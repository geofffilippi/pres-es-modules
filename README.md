# Node ES Modules

Slides from talk given on July 21, 2016 at the Node.js Denver/Boulder/Ft. Collins Meetup at Code Talent in Denver

>Full-stack module support is coming to JavaScript. The community has been working around the lack of standardized module support for several years. In the void, an ecosystem of alternative JavaScript module implementations sprung up. Node settled on a CommonJS-influenced module format. Client-side JavaScript module implementations are divided between CommonJS and AMD. Standardization has finally arrived to pave over these cowpaths.

>This talk will start with a brief overview and history of modules in JavaScript. We will discuss the ES module standards. Finally, we will look at current and upcoming ES module implementations. Expect to walk away with an understanding of how to use ES modules now in node.
